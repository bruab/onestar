Here's a list of artists/musicians/writers whose origin stories don't seem to feature (publicly-documented) criticism.

_This doesn't mean they didn't face criticism!_ They probably did. It just didn't get documented, or I failed to find it.

## Enrico Caruso

The famous Italian tenor's first music teacher allegedly claimed "He has no voice at all and cannot sing a note." I could not find any source for this quote.

## Margaret Mitchell

The oft-cited factoid that _Gone With the Wind_ was rejected by "25 publishers" (_Rejections of the Written Famous_) or "38 publishers" ([HowStuffWorks](https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/literature/14-best-selling-books-repeatedly-rejected-by-publishers.htm#pt11)) turns out to be [apocryphal](http://brendacoulter.blogspot.com/2008/05/q-how-many-times-was-gone-with-wind.html).

## Prince

The rare case of an artist who seems to have started off with mostly unanimous support, and only accumulated haters as he gained in fame.

Prince had connections and advocates within the music industry, and his first album got good reviews. Whatever haters he had in the early days have vanished into history.
