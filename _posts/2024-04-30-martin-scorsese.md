> ... his script and direction lack any dramatic value ...

—_Variety_, reviewing Scorsese's first film

> The director, who also wrote the original story and screenplay, hasn't succeeded in making a drama that is really much more aware than the characters themselves. The result is a movie that is as precise—and as small—as a contact print.

—_The New York Times_, reviewing the same

> Marty, you've just spent a whole year of your life making a piece of shit. 

—Friend and fellow director John Cassavetes, reacting to Scorsese's second film
