> ... his script and direction lack any dramatic value ...

—[_Variety_](https://variety.com/1967/film/reviews/who-s-that-knocking-at-my-door-1200421457/)

> The director, who also wrote the original story and screenplay, hasn't succeeded in making a drama that is really much more aware than the characters themselves. The result is a movie that is as precise—and as small—as a contact print.

After working for two years on his first film, _Who's That Knocking at My Door_, the young writer and director Martin Scorses saw it accepted to the Chicago International Film Festival ... and then saw it picked apart by critics and industry types alike.

From reviews that questioned his directorial abilities and vision, to a distributor who required Scorsese to film and splice in a gratuitous sex scene before releasing the film into theaters, the reception was anything but encouraging.

His next film, _Boxcar Bertha_, met with even harsher criticism, with fellow director John Cassavetes [telling Scorsese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcar_Bertha#cite_ref-13)"Marty, you've just spent a whole year of your life making a piece of shit." 

But just two years later, he would receive his first Academy Award nomination for _Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore_, and then go on to receive _a hundred more nominations_, and 20 wins.
