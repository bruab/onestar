> He writes the ugliest music extant.

—_Dramatic and Musical Review_, 1843

> Composition indeed!—decomposition is the proper word for such hateful fungi, which choke up and poison the fertile plains of harmony, threatening the world with drought.

—_Musical World_, 1855

> Liszt's orchestral music is an insult to art. It is gaudy music harlotry, savage and incoherent bellowings.

—[_Boston Gazette_](https://archive.org/details/lexiconofmusical00nico), 1872
