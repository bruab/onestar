_Poet, 19th century (1830-1886)_

## Acclaim

- Listed as one of the 26 writers "central to [The Western Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Western_Canon)"â€”alongside Shakespeare, Dante, Chaucer, and Tolstoy
- Put on a [postal stamp](https://postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibition/women-on-stamps-part-3-literature-poets/emily-dickinson)

## Criticism

- Only published 10 of her 1800+ poems within her lifetime, and these were [edited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson#cite_note-:0-8) to conform to contemporary styles
- Posthumously-published poems were [censored](https://archive.ph/20200326042600/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/29/magazine/beethoven-s-hair-tells-all.html) to remove the name "Susan"
- From writer Andrew Lang: "If poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme." ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson#cite_ref-169))
