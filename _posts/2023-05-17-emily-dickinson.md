> If poetry is to exist at all, it really must have form and grammar, and must rhyme when it professes to rhyme."

—Writer Andrew Lang

> It is plain that Miss Dickinson possessed an extremely unconventional and grotesque fancy ... an eccentric, dreamy, half-educated recluse in an out-of-the-way New England village (or anywhere else) cannot with impunity set at defiance the laws of gravitation and grammar.

—Novelist Thomas Bailey Aldrich
