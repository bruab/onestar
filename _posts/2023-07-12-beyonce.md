How do you measure the success of a musical artist?

Is it by album sales? Concert revenue? Maybe it's about having a fan base so huge and devoted that their obsession is fictionalized in a TV series.

By all of these metrics, Beyoncé has made it. Billboard's [top female artist of the decade](https://web.archive.org/web/20110829104158/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/news/e3id4ade3d3e7f8db80b4071ff7aba918fc). Multiple [8-figure tours](https://www.billboard.com/pro/beyonce-renaissance-world-tour-how-much-money/). [_Swarm_](https://ew.com/tv/donald-glover-swarm-sister-to-atlanta-inspirations/).

An unequivocal, unparalleled success—_unless_ your metric is critical approval.

Within that realm, we find quite a bit of doubt. Like in the New York Times review of her first album, entitled [_The Solo Beyoncé: She's No Ashanti_](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/arts/music-the-solo-beyonce-she-s-no-ashanti.html), which conjectures:

> Maybe this album is merely a misstep ... Or maybe it's proof that she isn't quite as versatile as she seemed. 

Or [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jun/27/popandrock.artsfeatures8) which, reviewing the same album, says "there is barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune."

20 years later, the majority of critics had changed their minds. Beyoncé released 2022's _Renaissance_ to considerable acclaim. But the holdouts remain—depending on whom you ask, the album is either "[a master class](https://ew.com/music/music-reviews/beyonce-renaissance-review/)" or "[a massive PR campaign](https://www.popmatters.com/beyonce-renaissance-post-covid-soiree)."
