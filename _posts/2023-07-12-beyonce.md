Beyoncé Giselle Knowles, born in 1981 and known simply as Beyoncé, is one of the most successful musicians of all time. She was Billboard's [top female artist of the decade](https://web.archive.org/web/20110829104158/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/news/e3id4ade3d3e7f8db80b4071ff7aba918fc) in the 2000s, has run multiple [8-figure tours](https://www.billboard.com/pro/beyonce-renaissance-world-tour-how-much-money/), and inspires such devotion among her listeners that she inspired a [TV series on the topic of obsessive fandom](https://ew.com/tv/donald-glover-swarm-sister-to-atlanta-inspirations/).

Not everyone saw it coming. Here's a quote from the New York Times review of her first album, entitled [_The Solo Beyoncé: She's No Ashanti_](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/06/arts/music-the-solo-beyonce-she-s-no-ashanti.html):

> Maybe this album is merely a misstep ... Or maybe it's proof that she isn't quite as versatile as she seemed. 

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jun/27/popandrock.artsfeatures8), reviewing the same album, said "there is barely a track here with any distinctive identity or even a tune."

20 years later, the majority of critics had changed their minds. Beyoncé released 2022's _Renaissance_ to considerable acclaim. But the holdouts remain—depending on whom you ask, the album is either "[a master class](https://ew.com/music/music-reviews/beyonce-renaissance-review/)" or "[a massive PR campaign](https://www.popmatters.com/beyonce-renaissance-post-covid-soiree)."
