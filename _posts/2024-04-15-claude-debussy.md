> Rhythm, melody, tonality, these are three things unknown to Monsieur Debussy and deliberately disdained by him. His music is vague, floating, without color and without shape ...

—Arthur Pougin, 1902

> The music of M. Debussy leads to the emaciation and ruin of our essence. It contains germs not of life and progress, but of decadence and death.

—Camille Bellaigue, _Revue des Deux Mondes_, 1902
