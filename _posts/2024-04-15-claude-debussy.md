> Rhythm, melody, tonality, these are three things unknown to Monsieur Debussy and deliberately disdained by him. His music is vague, floating, without color and without shape ...

—[Arthur Pougin](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586732_JSE_editorial_26-1_on_foolish_scientific_invective), 1902

> The music of M. Debussy leads to the emaciation and ruin of our essence. It contains germs not of life and progress, but of decadence and death.

—[Camille Bellaigue](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586732_JSE_editorial_26-1_on_foolish_scientific_invective), _Revue des Deux Mondes_, 1902

Claude Debussy was maligned by critics throughout his career, an unfortunate treatment that seems almost inevitable when you consider his revolutionary contributions to music.

He's credited with [marking the beginning of modern music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A9lude_%C3%A0_l%27apr%C3%A8s-midi_d%27un_faune). He popularized the use of nonstandard scales and "blue notes"—Duke Ellington [cites him as an influence](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/the-velvet-revolution-of-claude-debussy).

There's no way to have this kind of impact without offending critics. As Debussy himself [said](https://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/article/the-debussy-legacy):

> I am trying to do “something different” ... what the imbeciles call “impressionism”, a term which is as poorly used as possible ...
