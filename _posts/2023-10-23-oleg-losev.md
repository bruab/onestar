Despite having no formal education, Oleg Losev (1903-1942) published 43 papers and obtained 16 patents during his brief career.

He was the first to discover _and_ found applications for light-emitting diode (LED) technology, solid-state amplifiers, and electronic oscillators (a key component of TVs and radios).

Despite his talents, he spent most of his career as a lab technician. He died of starvation at age 38, and most of his research was forgottenâ€”so much so that LED technology was [rediscovered by American scientists in 1962](https://web.archive.org/web/20110511132457/http://www.nanophotonics.org.uk/niz/publications/zheludev-2007-ltl.pdf), decades after his death.
