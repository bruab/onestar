> The entire works of Chopin present a motley surface of ranting hyperbole and excruciating cacophany.

—_Musical World_, 1841

> M. Chopin increasingly effects the crudest modulations. Cunning must be the connoiseur, indeed, who, while listening to his music, can form the slightest idea when wrong notes are played ...

—H.F. Chorley, 1845, 1841
