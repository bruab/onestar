> The entire works of Chopin present a motley surface of ranting hyperbole and excruciating cacophany.

—[_Musical World_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586732_JSE_editorial_26-1_on_foolish_scientific_invective), 1841

> M. Chopin increasingly effects the crudest modulations. Cunning must be the connoiseur, indeed, who, while listening to his music, can form the slightest idea when wrong notes are played ...

—[H.F. Chorley, 1845](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586732_JSE_editorial_26-1_on_foolish_scientific_invective), 1841

Chopin confounded his critics. They didn't like the way he mostly avoided playing concerts, favoring informal performances in salons. They didn't like the discordant nature of his compositions. He was recognized as a virtuoso, and it seems like some folks would have preferred him to be ... just a bit less virtuosic.

Whether it was his innovative approach to pedaling, his favor for dissonance, or his habit of (gasp!) striking [two black keys at a time with his thumb](https://www.classical-music.com/features/composers/chopins-legacy-the-enduring-appeal-of-the-remarkable-composer), his every offense to contemporary musical sensibilities was also a step forward for future musical _possibilities_. 

Over a century later, the critiques he faced during his lifetime are balanced out by the scores of musicians who have taken inspiration from his work:

> I love Chopin. He's my dawg.
