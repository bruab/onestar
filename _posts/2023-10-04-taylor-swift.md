It's hard to overstate Taylor Swift's success. She was named Artist of the Decade by the American Music Awards, after being the second highest-grossing live music artist of the 2010s—such that the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook202307.htm) made mention of her impact on local economies.

And critics hailed her talent from the very beginning—_Country Weekly_ claimed her first album (released at age 16) "suggests a talent poised to last well past high school," while _Billboard_ praised the "genius" of her second album.

Not all critics, though. _The Guardian_ referred to that same second album as "[a record that does something bland and uninventive but does it incredibly well.](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/06/taylor-swift-fearless-album-review)" And _Slant Magazine_ decried "[the serious limitations that she simply hasn’t attempted to improve upon since her debut](https://www.slantmagazine.com/music/taylor-swift-fearless/)," and goes on to say "Swift’s greatest liability by far is that she’s a terrible singer." It's interesting to note that this extremely negative reviewer still hedges their bets on Swift's future: "Swift’s age still gives her ample time to hone her craft into something more substantial and more sophisticated."
