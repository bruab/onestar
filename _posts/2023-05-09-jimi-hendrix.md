In 1967, The Jimi Hendrix Experience released _Are You Experienced_, an album that went [quintuple platinum](https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Jimi+Hendrix&ti=Are+You+Experienced&format=Album&type=#search_section), inspired generations of guitarists, and “established the transcendent promise of psychedelia.”

The above quote is from [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/jimi-hendrix-are-you-experienced-1063203/), which ranked _Are You Experienced_ as #30 in their list of the top 500 albums of all time.

That's not always how they felt.

When the record first came out, Rolling Stone [summed it up as follows](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/album-reviews-jimi-hendrix-and-eric-clapton-188030/):

> Above all this record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that.

They also lamented “the poor quality of the songs and the inanity of the lyrics.” This is a criticism Hendrix heard often enough to respond to:

> All I'm writing is just what I feel, that's all. I just keep it almost naked. And probably the words are so bland.
