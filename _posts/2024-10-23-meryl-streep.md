> Meryl Streep’s technique doesn’t add up to anything. We’re not fascinated by [her character]; she’s so distanced from us that all we can do is observe how meticulous Streep— and everything else about the movie— is.

—Pauline Kael, reviewing _Kramer vs. Kramer_

> She doesn’t seem to know how to draw on herself, she hasn’t yet released an innate personality on the screen.

—Pauline Kael again, reviewing _Silkwood_
