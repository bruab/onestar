â€”[Rolling Stone magazine](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/led-zeppelin-i-187298/), March 1969

Despite harsh reviews of their debut album by Rolling Stone, Led Zeppelin went on to become "the biggest band of the Seventies", and "unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history" ... according to Rolling Stone.

They released 8 number one albums in a row, they've been inducted in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, and artists ranging from Madonna to Lady Gaga to the Ramones have cited them as an influence.
