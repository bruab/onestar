When _Ace Ventura: Pet Detective_ came out in 1994, Jim Carrey already had a ten-year film career behind him, as well as four years starring in the Fox TV series _In Living Color_.

Here's what prominent film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert [had to say](https://siskelebert.org/?p=5206) about Carrey's contribution as star and co-writer:

> … appallingly bad movie … Jim Carrey is so obnoxious … so obnoxious … shockingly bad.

In a [roundtable discussion](https://youtu.be/yz0bjLk9rUo?t=1892) recorded years later, Carrey talks about how he felt when he read their review, three days before the movie’s release. It’s as you’d expect - disappointment, uncertainty.

But he goes on to explain how just a few years later, both critics recanted their initial review and recorded a [special episode of their show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF8nKGlTb7c) paying tribute to Carrey.

An episode with quotes like this:

> [His movies] are all hits!
>
> … he has perfect verbal comic timing …
>
> … I am a little bit humbled since that first review.

This turnabout didn't come as a result of any change on the actor's part. Jim Carrey kept being obnoxious, in movies like _The Mask_ and _Dumb and Dumber_. He even made a sequel to _Ace Ventura_.

He just … kept going.

And along the way, he found a huge audience, made millions of people laugh, and eventually wore down even his harshest critics.
