> Her "penchant for the mundane renders her intensity as bogus as her mannered melismas" ... a "middlebrow keyboard tickler"

A young, Juillard-trained Nina Simone was rejected by the Curtis Institute of Music—according to her, as a result of racial prejudice. Her outspoken lyrics led to a falling out with her record label. She struggled with bipolar disorder and eventually exiled herself from the United States for good.

But through all these struggles she continued to write, record, and perform, and ended up inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, having a street named after her in the Netherlands, being ranked as the 21st greatest singer of all time by _Rolling Stone_ ... and receiving an honorary degree from Curtis Institute of Music.
