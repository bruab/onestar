> Technique, however, is not enough to make a great writer, and that is what we have been asked to believe Mr. Hemingway was in process of becoming. The indications of such a growth are absent from this book ... There is evidence of no mental growth whatever; there is no better understanding of life, no increase in his power to illuminate it or even to present it. Essentially, this new novel is an empty book.

—_The New York Times_ review of _To Have and Have Not_, 1937

> _The Sun Also Rises_ is the kind of book that makes this reviewer at least almost plain angry.

—_The Chicago Tribune_

> [His characters are as] shallow as the saucers in which they stack their daily emotion.

—_The Dial_, reviewing _The Sun Also Rises_
