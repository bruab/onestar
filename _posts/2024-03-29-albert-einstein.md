> I feel as if I had been wandering with Alice in Wonderland and had tea with the Mad Hatter.

—Astronomer [Charles Lane Poor](https://bigthink.com/the-past/einstein-critics/), on reading Einstein's theory of relativity

> ... it can only be hoped that German science will not again be embarrassed by such sad scribblings.

—[Albert von Brunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_theory_of_relativity#A_Hundred_Authors_Against_Einstein), critiquing the theory

It's hard to imagine success greater than having one's name become a synonym for "genius," but Albert Einstein was not always recognized as such. After publishing his theory of relativity, he was met with disbelief, mockery, dismissal, and a considerable dose of antisemitism. (Physicist [Philipp Lenard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_theory_of_relativity#Chauvinism_and_antisemitism) referred to Einstein's work as "Jewish physics.")

The resistance was so formidable as to result in the publication of a book called [_A Hundred Authors Against Einstein_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_theory_of_relativity#A_Hundred_Authors_Against_Einstein). But almost a hundred years later, these authors' objections are mostly forgotten and dismissed, while the Nobel-prize-winning target of their hostility has an [element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsteinium) and an [asteroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Einstein) named after him, and was chosen as the [person of the century](https://web.archive.org/web/20000511091944/http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/albert_einstein5a.html) by Time magazine.
