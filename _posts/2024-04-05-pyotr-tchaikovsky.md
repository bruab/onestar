> ... a musical monster ... ear-flaying horror.

—Richard Würst, [reviewing _Francesca da Rimini_](https://archive.org/details/lexiconofmusical00nico)

Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was a composer who clearly challenged the taste and sensibilities of critics. Throughout his entire career, across Europe and the United States, he received consistent attacks for his style ("dissonant convulsions"), his ambition ("as difficult for popular apprehension as the name of the composer") and his Russian-ness:

> ... decidedly too Russian ...

—Eduard Hanslick, _Neue Freie Presse_, Vienna, 1876

> ... the lack of nobleness, the barbarous side by which, according to ethnographs and diplomats, even the most polished Russian at times betrays himself.

—_Musical Review_, New York, 1880

> ... transfers us to a brutal and wretched jollity of a Russian holiday. We see plainly the savage vulgar faces, we hear curses, we smell vodka.

—Eduard Hanslick (again), _Neue Freie Presse_, Vienna, 1881

He also faced a considerable obstacle in the fact that "full time composer" was not actually a career in late 19th-century Russia.

Despite all this, his music has endured to see an era where calling things "too Russian" no longer serves as a valid critique, where the challenging, discordant elements in his compositions have gone on to influence generations of artists, to the point that most ballet companies owe [40% of their annual revenue](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20131223/ARTS/131229961/the-nutcracker-brings-big-bucks-to-ballet-companies) to _The Nutcracker_.
