> ... a musical monster ... ear-flaying horror.

—Richard Würst, reviewing _Francesca da Rimini_

> ... decidedly too Russian ...

—Eduard Hanslick, _Neue Freie Presse_, Vienna, 1876

> ... the lack of nobleness, the barbarous side by which, according to ethnographs and diplomats, even the most polished Russian at times betrays himself.

—_Musical Review_, New York, 1880

> ... transfers us to a brutal and wretched jollity of a Russian holiday. We see plainly the savage vulgar faces, we hear curses, we smell vodka.

—Eduard Hanslick (again), _Neue Freie Presse_, Vienna, 1881
