> It is absurd to think that germs causing fermentation and putrefaction came from the air; the atmosphere would have to be as thick as pea soup for that.

- [Dr. Nicolas Joly](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586732_JSE_editorial_26-1_on_foolish_scientific_invective)

Despite mockery from some of his colleagues, and in brave rebellion against the prevailing "theory of spontaneous generation"—which held that living things could emerge out of nowhere—Louis Pasteur's research advanced our understanding of fermentation, led to the development of vaccines for anthrax and rabies, and of course introduced the process of pasterization to remove bacteria from milk.
