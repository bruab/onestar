> Weep over the lifelessness of the melody and harmony, so derivative, so stale, so inexpressive!

—Lawrence Gilman, reviewing _Rhapsody in Blue_ for the [_New York Tribune_](http://www.classicalnotes.net/classics4/gershwinconcerto.html)

{% comment %} Quote from Slonimsky {% endcomment %}

After over a decade of working behind the scenes—first as a department store pianist and then as a composer and arranger of piano rolls—George Gershwin composed his first major work, _Rhapsody in Blue_, in 1924. Audiences enjoyed the piece, but many critics didn't know what to make of it, and opted to tear it to shreds. 

Gerswhin's subsequent works met with similar hostility, with critics [calling](https://slate.com/culture/2009/02/when-music-critics-attack.html) _An American in Paris_ "dull, patchy, thin, vulgar, long-winded and inane" and [saying](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:ry540ts7742/31-01.pdf) of _Porgy and Bess_ "you wonder how the composer ... could stoop to such easy and such needless conquests."

Gershwin seems to have ignored this feedback and continued about his work, an approach that paid off. _The Guardian_ calculated that he was the [highest-earning composer of all time](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/aug/29/arts.media1). He's been posthumously awarded an Academy Award, a Congressional Gold Medal, and a special Pulitzer Prize. And _Porgy and Bess_, that "needless" composition, is now the official state opera of South Carolina.
