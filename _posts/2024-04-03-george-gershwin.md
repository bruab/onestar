> Weep over the lifelessness of the melody and harmony, so derivative, so stale, so inexpressive!

—Lawrence Gilman, reviewing _Rhapsody in Blue_ for the _New York Tribune_, 1924

> ... dull, patchy, thin, vulgar, long-winded and inane"

—Herbert F. Peyser, reviewing _An American in Paris_ for the _New York Telegram_, 1928

> ...you wonder how the composer ... could stoop to such easy and such needless conquests."

—Lawrence Gilman again, this time reviewing _Porgy and Bess_ for the _New York Herald Tribune_, 1935
