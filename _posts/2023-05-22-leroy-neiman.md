> [Neiman is famous] because millions of people watch sports programs, read Playboy and will take any amount of glib ab-ex slather so long as it adorns a recognisable and pert pair of jugs.

—Art critic Robert Hughes

> The archetypical hack...With his ever-present cigar and enormous mustache, he was a cliché of the bon vivant and a bad artist in every way

> All frosting, no cake.

—Ken Johnson, _The New York Times_, 2012
