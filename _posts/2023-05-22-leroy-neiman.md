## Criticism

> [Neiman is famous] because millions of people watch sports programs, read Playboy and will take any amount of glib ab-ex slather so long as it adorns a recognisable and pert pair of jugs

—[Robert Hughes](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/jun/21/leroy-neiman-famous-artist-great)

> The archetypical hack...With his ever-present cigar and enormous mustache, he was a cliché of the bon vivant and a bad artist in every way

> All frosting, no cake.
