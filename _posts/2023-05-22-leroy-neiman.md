_Painter (1921-2012)_

One of the most successful artists of all time, LeRoy Neiman was selected five times to be the [official painter of the Olympic Games](https://observer.com/2020/07/leroy-neiman-painter-olympic-and-paralympic-museum/). He painted (and befriended) [Muhammad Ali](https://alicenter.org/event/muhammad-and-leroy-a-friendship-in-art-digital-exhibit/) and was the artist in residence for the [New York Jets](https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,2118535,00.html)

Over the course of his career, he [made millions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/leroy-neiman-celebrity-artist-of-the-sporting-world/2012/06/21/gJQAJwMstV_story.html), and [_gave away_ millions to underprivileged artists](https://leroyneimanfoundation.org/).

All this success and generosity did not translate to critical adoration. One detractor [explained his career as follows](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/jun/21/leroy-neiman-famous-artist-great):

> [Neiman is famous] because millions of people watch sports programs, read Playboy and will take any amount of glib ab-ex slather so long as it adorns a recognisable and pert pair of jugs

Another [summed him up this way](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/arts/design/leroy-neiman-and-the-serious-art-world.html):

> The archetypical hack...With his ever-present cigar and enormous mustache, he was a clichÃ© of the bon vivant and a bad artist in every way

> All frosting, no cake.
