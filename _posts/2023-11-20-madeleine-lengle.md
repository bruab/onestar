- Published half a dozen novels to low sales and lukewarm reception
- Decided to quit writing at age 40
- _A Wrinkle In Time_ was rejected by 26 publishers

Madeleine L'Engle wrote for decades in obscurity and endured rejection after rejection before finding a publisher for her breakthrough novel, _A Wrinkle In Time_.

From there, she went on to publish dozens of books. She won the Newberry Medal, a Lifetime Achievement award from the World Fantasy Awards, and a space in the New York Writers Hall of Fame. There's even a [crater on Mercury named after her](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Engle_(crater)).
