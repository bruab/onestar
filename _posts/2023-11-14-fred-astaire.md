> Can't act; slightly bald; can dance a little.

—[Note from casting director on his first screen test](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/08/07/bald/)

Fred Astaire did not exactly inspire confidence in the producer who first signed him to a Hollywood production company.

> I am uncertain about the man, but I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is so tremendous that it comes through even on this wretched test.

—[David O. Selznick](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire)

The doubts didn't last long.

He starred in two musicals during his very first year in Hollywood, the second of which elicited this review from [_Variety_ magazine](https://variety.com/1933/film/reviews/flying-down-to-rio-1200410897/):

>  He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer, he remains in a class by himself.

He went on to make dozens of films, win two Academy Awards and multiple Golden Globes, and revolutionize the way dance was presented in film—both from a technical perspective and as a storytelling device.

Today you'll find him memorialized in songs by Madonna, Donna Summer, and Too Short, and as a member of the Film, Television, and Grammy Halls of Fame.
