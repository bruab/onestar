_Author and journalist (1903-1966)_

Waugh wrote _Brideshead Revisited_, which was chosen as #80 on [Modern Library's 100 Best Novels in the English Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Library_100_Best_Novels). His renown was such that he was offered the [Order of the British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Waugh#cite_ref-167).

He may have received the recognition of the royal family, but his peers weren't quite as encouraging. Waugh sent a draft of his first novel to friend Harold Acton, who said

> Too British for my exotic taste ... too much nid-nodding over port.

Waugh then [burned the draft and attempted to drown himself](https://archive.org/details/littlelearning0000waug/page/324/mode/2up?q=acton) by swimming out to sea, but returned after being stung by a jellyfish.
