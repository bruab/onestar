> I do not believe that a single composition of Wagner will survive him.

—Music theorist [Moritz Hauptmann](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586732_JSE_editorial_26-1_on_foolish_scientific_invective), 1849

> There is no law prohibiting to write when one has no ideas whatsoever. The work of Monsieur Wagner is therefore perfectly legal.

—[_National_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586732_JSE_editorial_26-1_on_foolish_scientific_invective), 1850

> Destitute of melody, extremely bad in harmony, utterly incoheret in form and inexpressive of any intelligible ideas whatever ...

—W.H. Glover reviewing _Tannhäuser_ in the [_Morning Post_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331586732_JSE_editorial_26-1_on_foolish_scientific_invective), 1855

Richard Wagner is one of music's most controversial figures. Among some circles, hating his music served as a badge of honor and good taste—during his lifetime and beyond. But his accomplishments and influence speak for themselves.

Some music historians trace the beginning of the modern classical era not just to Wagner, but to the opening notes of his opera _Tristan und Isolde_. He paved the way for the practice of atonality in 20th century music. 
He inspired musicians from Debussy and Mahler to Phil Spector and Manowar, whose bassist [referred to Wagner](https://books.google.com/books?id=lGI5X1eEVokC&q=heavy+metal#v=snippet&q=heavy%20metal&f=false) as "the father of heavy metal."
