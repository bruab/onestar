Writing about Austen in 1850, the author Charlotte Brontë said

> She ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him by nothing profound. The passions are perfectly unknown to her …

Mark Twain was weirdly aggressive in his criticism:

> … her books madden me so that I can’t conceal my frenzy … Every time I read Pride and Prejudice I want to dig her up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.

Notwithstanding the judgement of her peers, _Pride and Prejudice_ has sold over 20 million copies, spawned multiple film adaptations, and made its way onto many a high school reading list.
