By any metric, Jane Austen is a hugely influential author.

_Pride and Prejudice_ has sold over 20 million copies, spawned multiple film adaptations, and made its way onto many a high school reading list.

_Emma_ is #9 on _The Guardian_’s [100 greatest novels of all time](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/oct/12/features.fiction).

This great influence has not translated to the esteem of her peers. Writing about Austen in 1850, the author Charlotte Brontë said

> She ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him by nothing profound. The passions are perfectly unknown to her …

Mark Twain was weirdly aggressive in his criticism:

> … her books madden me so that I can’t conceal my frenzy … Every time I read Pride and Prejudice I want to dig her up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.

Obviously Austen can't respond to Twain's commentary, but she does leave us with a relevant quote regarding how much credence to give him:

> Angry people are not always wise.
