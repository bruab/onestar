> Socrates belonged to the lowest of the low: Socrates was mob. You know, and you can still see it for yourself, how ugly he was.

—Friedrich Nietzsche, _Twilight of the Idols_

> Socrates was a pompous windbag and … the citizens of Athens deserve a small award for putting and end to his tedious speeches … Despite his role as a traitor surely Socrates deserved death because of his life spent as a tedious bore.

—Amazon user Tom Munro
