Do it: Write the book, record the album, sculpt the statue you see when you close your eyes.

And know this: When you share it, someone will come along and tell you it's terrible.

You can be sure of that fact prior to the act of creation, because it's true for _every_ work that reaches a large enough audience. (Yes, it's true you can escape criticism _in your lifetime_ by keeping your work hidden away. Like Emily Dickinson, whose poetry was discovered after her death, and proceeded to enrage a handful of very vocal critics.)

So what should you do, knowing that inevitably someone will tell you your life's work amounts to nothing? You should do it anyway, of course.

But that's easier said than done. The anticipation of harsh words will discourage you from starting and deter you from sharing. And when they come, they'll make you reconsider your worth. That's where this book comes in.

## How to use this book

Flip through it until you find the name of someone you admire. Make a note of the setbacks and insults they received. Ask yourself, what if they had let it stop them? What if Beyoncé had retired after her first album? What if Marie Curie had retracted her findings and burned her notebooks? What if Alfred Hitchcock had quit filmmaking to pursue a career as a tax attorney?

The world—_your_ world—would be poorer because of it. And the same is true if you give up because of someone's unsolicited, ungenerous, quite likely wrong opinion.

Come back to this book and remind yourself of that fact, as often as you need to.
